# Web Pages

{Describe each of the web pages you created and how the web app transitions between each of them.  Also describe what is dynamically created on each page.}


# Development Environment

Tools
* Visual Studio Code

Programming Languages and Libraries
* Python
* Django
* SQLite
* HTML/CSS

# Useful Websites

* [Django Official Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/)
* [Real Python: Getting Started with Django](https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/)

# Future Work

* More fully developed template pages would make the web app much more entertaining to use. 
* I needed to dedicate more time to learning Django to appreciate it more. Instead, I got frustrated working with it and wished I was working with a different web app framework instead.
* An account system would result in a more honest voting system and could provide interesting information for people looking back at what they had done on the platform.
